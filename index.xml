Simply stated, the question is this: why do anything? Posed completely on its own, it might not be clear what anyone could be getting at by asking such a question. So let&amp;rsquo;s describe how a person might come to ask something like this.
Pursuing any kind of creative endeavour can be emotionally challenging. One of the most common struggles that comes up is in trying to convince yourself that whatever you have to say is important.</description></item><item><title>Adjoints, Inverses, and AIs</title><link>https://davesque.github.io/posts/2023/02/28/adjoints-inverses-and-ais/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 18:09:45 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://davesque.github.io/posts/2023/02/28/adjoints-inverses-and-ais/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some reading about &amp;ldquo;adjoints&amp;rdquo; which are often contrasted with &amp;ldquo;inverses&amp;rdquo; in mathematics. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example illustrating the behavior of a matrix inverse:
\[ \begin{align*} A\mathbf{x} &amp;amp;= \mathbf{y} \\ \implies \mathbf{x} &amp;amp;= A^{-1}\mathbf{y} \end{align*} \]
We&amp;rsquo;re just seeing that \(A^{-1}\) undoes the transformation done by \(A\) to \(\mathbf{x}\) to get \(\mathbf{y}\). This is only something that&amp;rsquo;s possible for &amp;ldquo;nice&amp;rdquo; (non-singular) matrices. Better hope your matrix is nice. By contrast, the &amp;ldquo;adjoint&amp;rdquo; of \(A\) (often denoted \(A^{*}\)) works in this way:</description></item></channel></rss>
