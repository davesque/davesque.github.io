Let me tell the story of when my mind was once blown after discovering a
certain mathematical fact.  That fact is that there are different "sizes" of
infinity.

Actually, what I first discovered was that mathematicians generally agree that
there are as many integers as there are rational numbers[^1]. This seems
counter-intuitive.  Between any two integers, there can only be a finite number
of other integers (if any).  However, between any two integers, there are
*infinitely* many rationals.  In fact, this is even true for any two rationals!
Somehow, this fabric of numbers called the rationals, which can always be
subdivided more finely, is said to be "as large" as the integers.

Let's take a journey and see how one could arrive at this understanding.  By
the end of this article, we hope to have demonstrated a few things (though not
necessarily in this order):

1. There are different sizes of infinity.
1. Many of the common, infinitely large "groups of things" we encounter in
   every day life (the whole numbers, the integers, and the rationals) can be
   said to be as large as each other.
1. The so-called "real" numbers, which includes things like \\(\pi\\) and
   Euler's number \\(e\\), are surprisingly different in this regard.  There
   are far more real numbers than there are whole numbers, integers, or
   rationals.
1. The observation that there are different sizes of infinity says a lot about
   how mathematicians use the concept of infinity and how following a seemingly
   dry line of reasoning can lead to a completely surprising conclusion.

With that in mind, let's get started!

## Definitions

First, we should lay out a few definitions.  Many of these might seem basic to
some readers, but it's not too much trouble to spell them out.  We also hope
that anyone with some mathematical curiosity might follow along.

When trying to answer a particular question, it can often be better to start by
answering one that is similar but more simple.  So let's start by asking, "Are
there as many natural numbers as there are integers?"

[^1]: In case anyone needs reminding, the integers are just the whole numbers
  including negative numbers and zero. The rationals are those numbers that can
  be represented as a ratio of two integers.  This does not include things like
  \\(\sqrt{2}\\) which cannot be represented as a ratio of two integers.
