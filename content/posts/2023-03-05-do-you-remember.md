That is, do you remember the fist time you achieved something you were proud
of, no matter how small?

The other day, I had a long train of thought that eventually terminated at this
question.  The original impulse was pretty familiar: a need to find a coping
mechanism for the sense of embarrassment that I often feel after publicly
sharing some kind of creative output.

This is something I'm sure we can all relate to.  We're inspired to labor at
something and then share the result of that process.  Then, we react to our own
result by asking questions like, "Is this actually that interesting?  Has
someone else already thought of this?  Is this naive, juvenile, etc.?  Will
someone else look at this and think, 'That's cute.'?"

I suppose the answers to all of those questions, respectively, are "No, yes,
yes, and yes."  Or, it could be "Yes, no, no, and no."  That would depend upon
who's reacting to your creative product and whatever mood they happen to be
in[^1].

Since those questions don't seem to have a definitive answer, it feels more
interesting to probe their origin.

*We're trying to get to that sense of joy at learning and understanding.  And
then, especially, the way in which that joy is significantly amplified by
sharing the knowledge or details of the process.  I believe that a joyful
intellectualism could be one of the most healing balms we could apply to our
society.*

*Pursuit of that joy can also be a strong justification for undertaking
creative work.  It can work to alleviate doubts about the value of that work.
It may be true that some creative product is derivative, redundant, boring,
etc. etc.  However, it shouldn't matter if the impulse was to pursue that
joyfulness.  It can be a balm for self-doubt.  Just remember why you did that
thing to begin with.  You did it because you enjoy it.  At the end of the day,
that's all that really matters.*

[^1]: Of course, the "who" could be oneself.
