## About

Hey there!

This is a blog about technology and other topics of occasional interest.
Herein, you'll find writing that I do mostly for my own sake.

If you're curious who maintains this blog, feel free to click the GitHub link
at the bottom and do a bit of harmless stalking.  I'm okay with that.

Enjoy!
