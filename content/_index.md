## About

Hey there!  I'm David.  I'm a software engineer living in Seattle, WA.  This is
my website.  Herein, you'll find thoughts about technology and other topics of
occasional interest.

I've been working full time as an engineer since about 2011.  Since then, I've
done a variety of different kinds of work.  In the past few years, I've gotten
more focused on data engineering, data science, and machine learning.
